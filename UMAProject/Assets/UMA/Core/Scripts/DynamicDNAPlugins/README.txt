All the new scripts are just in this folder so its easy to find them and check them out.

I *think* that, like 'MorphsetDNA' etc, this will be able to go in standard assets, but maybe not because of the refs to DynamicDNAConverterBehaviour- I'm still working on stuff tho so hopefully that will be possible.

I'd REALLY like this to be considered 'Core' as in totally core, i.e. hopefully with this when we do new things with dna they can be plugins that add to this, rather than ever more new branching systems.

I appreciate thats an ambitious aspiration, and it means that this has to be *really* good and something you all feel you can work with without having to compromise anything. 

So I am totally open to everyones feedback and input. What I really hope is that we can get this to a level where it becomes how we develop dna features in the future.
